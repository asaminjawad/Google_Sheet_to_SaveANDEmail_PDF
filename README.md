### Google sheet to PDF App Script

- Use this script to create PDF from a google docs template and get data from google sheet. 
- Email the PDF to any email from the sheet as well. 
- Name the PDF dinamically from the data and Update the sheet with the date the email was sent. 
- To avoid sending duplicate email, the script will check if the date column is empty or not. It will only send the email if it's empty.
